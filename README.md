# Functional Programming with JavaScript
> This repo demonstrates how to build software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state mutable data, and side-effects..

####  Some advantages of functional programming are:
* Pure functions are easier to reason about
* Programs are easier to understand because they are at a higher level.
* Debugging is easier
* Function signatures are more meaningful
* Parallel/concurrent programming is easier
